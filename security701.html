<h1>CompTIA Security+ 701 Test Study</h1>
<pre>
<h2>01 General Security Concepts</h2>
<h3>01.01 Security Controls</h3> - prevent security event, minimize impact, & limit damage
    <b><i>Technical</i></b> - ex: firewall / anti-virus; os security
    <b><i>Managerial</i></b> - admin controls - security policy
    <b><i>Operational</i></b> - people, security guard
    <b><i>Physical</i></b> - fences, gates, and locks, guard shack

    <b>Preventive Control Type</b> 
        - technical = firewall; managerial = on boarding; operational=guards; physical = locked door
    <b>Deterrent Control Type</b> 
        - technical = splash screen; managerial = demotion / firing; operational = receptionist; physical = posted Warning signs
    <b>Detective Control Type</b> 
        - technical = system logs; managerial = reviewing logs; operational = someone patroling the grounds; physical = motion detectors
    <b>Corrective Control Type</b> 
        - technical = backup; managerial = policy for reporting issues; operational = contact authorities; physical = fire extinguisher
    <b>Compensating Control Type</b> - temp solution
        - technical = block instead of patch; managerial = separation of duties; operational = require multiple security; physical = backup generator
    <b>Directive Control Type</b> - relatively weak, means to 'direct' subject towards security compliance
        - technical = store 'sensitive' files in protected folder; managerial = create compliance policy; operational = security policy training; physical = "Authorized Personnel" sign 
<h3>01.02 CIA Triad; Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting; Gap Analysis; Zero Trust; Physical Security; Deception and Disruption</h3>
    <b>CIA Triad</b>
        <b>Confidentiality</b> - prevent unauthorized data disclosure
            <i>provide confidentiality through: </i>
                <b>encryption</b>
                <b>access controls</b> - restrict access to resource
                <b>authentication</b>
        <b>Integrity</b> - data remains the same; stored and transferred as intended
            <i>provide integrity through: </i>
                <b>hashing</b>
                <b>digital signatures</b>
                <b>certificates</b>
                <b>non-repudiation</b>
        <b>Availability</b> - systems are available
            <i>provide availability through: </i>
                <b>redundancy</b>
                <b>fault tollerance</b>
                <b>patching</b>

    <b>Non-repudiation</b> - being able to verify; 'no taking it back'
        <b>signing a contract</b> - signature adds non-repudiation; others can see the signature
        <b>adds different perspective to cryptography</b> - proof of integrity; proof of origin with high assurance
        <b>Proof of Integrity</b> - verify data remains accurate and the same
            <i>Hashing (or 'Message Digest')</i> - if the data changes the hash changes
        <b>Proof of Origin</b> - Authentication to prove source of message
            <i>signed with 'Private Key'</i> - Private Key is digital signature
            <i>verify with 'Public Key'</i> - Public Key is used to verify origin; changes to message will invalidate signature
        <b>add digital signature - Alice sends plaintext message and hashing algorithm makes hash of plaintext, 
                                 - hash is encrypted with sender (Alice's) private key creating the 'Digital Signature'
                                 - digital signature is sent with plaintext 
                                 - Bob receives message and decrypts digital signature with "Alice's Public Key"
                                 - program verifies hash of plaintext that decrypted from Alice's digital signature</b>

    <b>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting</b> - AAA Framework
        <b>Authentication</b> - Identification (verify we are who we say we are)
        <b>Authorization</b> - What access we have in the system
        <b>Accounting</b> - Logs of what happened; (ex: Login time, data sent and received, logout time)     

        <b>Authenticating People</b> - digitally signed certificates
            <b>Certificate Authority (CA)</b> - authenticates certificates, most large organizations maintain their own certificates
                - the organization will make a 'Certificate' for a device (laptop, tablet, client computer, etc...) and digitally sign the device with the organization's CA
                - the certificate is now used as the authentication for the device; the CA's digital signature is used to validate the certificate
        <b>Authorization Models</b> - associates Users (and Services) -> Data and Applications
              ** challenge is creating relationships that easily scale (not having to associate individual users to their access rights)
            Authorization model is often in the middle of the Users and Services allowing organization to define Roles     
            
        <b>Abstraction</b> - create 'Groups' inside the organization to easily assign 'Authorization' to users (ex: create 'shipping' group and put all shipping department employees into that group of authorizations)

    <b>Gap Analysis</b> - where you are compared to where you want to be, the 'gap' between the two
        <b>Work towards a known Baseline</b> - might be internal goals or organizational standards   
        <b>NIST Framework</b> 
        <b>ISO/IEC Framework</b>
    
        <b>Evaluate People and Processes</b>
        <b><i>Get a baseline of employees</i></b>
        <i>- Employee formal experience</i>
        <i>- Current training</i>
        <i>- Knowledge of security policies and procedures</i>
        
        <b><i>Examine the current processes</i></b>
        <i>- Research existing IT systems</i>
        <i>- Evaluate existing security policies</i>
    
        <b>Compare and Contrast</b>
        <b>the Comparison</b> - evaluate existing systems
        <b>Identify weakness</b> - along with the most effective processes

        <b>Analysis and Report</b>
        <b>the Final Comparison:</b>
            <i>- detailed baseline objectives</i>
            <i>- clear view of the current state</i>

    <b>Zero Trust</b> - holistic approach to network security, covers every device, every process, every person
        <b>Everything Must be Verified</b> - split network into 'Functional Planes' for physical, virtual, and cloud components

        <b>Functional Planes: </b>
            <i><b>Data Plane</b></i> (ports, phsyical ports)- processing frames, packets and networking data
            <i><b>Control Plane</b></i> (configuration settings, rules for the switch, etc...)- manages the actions of the data plane, define policies and rules (Routing Tables, Session Tables, NAT Tables)

        <b>Adaptive Identity</b> - make certain to consider the source of the requested resources, 
                                 - consider 'Risk Indicators' - relationship to organization, physical location, connection type, IP address, etc.
                                 - make authentication stronger, if necessary
        <b>Threat Scope Reduction</b> - decrease number of possible entry points
        <b>Policy-driven Access Control</b> - combine adaptive identity with predefined set of rules

        <b>Security Zones</b> - where person is connecting from; security is more than a 1-to-1 relationship
            <i>create Trusted and Untrusted zones depending on where the traffic originates</i>
            <i>Implicit Trust</i> - if from internal zone, then perhaps the user is trusted
        
        <b>Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)</b> - placed between the system and 'Trusted' Enterprise resources
        <b>Policy Decision Point (PDP)</b> - process for making the authentication decision 
            <b>Policy Engine</b> - evaluates access decision based on policy and info source; Grant, Deny, or Revoke
            <b>Policy Administrator</b> - communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), generates access tokens, tells PEP to allow or disallow access

        <b>Overview of Zero-point</b>:
          <b><i>- 'Subject' and 'System' from 'Untrusted' network communicate with PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) across the Data Plane.
                - The information is communicated to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) while in the Control Plane and the decision is communicated from the PDP / Control Plane, back to the PEP in the Data Plane
                - Access is Granted, Denied, or Revoked; if granted then access is allowed to the 'enterprise resource'</i></b>

    <b>Physical Security</b>
        <b>Bollard / Barricade</b> - prevent access, channel access to specific point, identify safety concern; could include concrete bollards or moats

        <b>Access control vesitbule</b> - control access to particular area

        <b>Fencing</b> - builds a perimeter

        <b>Video Surveillance</b> - CCTV (Closed Circuit TV)

        <b>Guards / Access badges</b> - physical protection; many times have multiple guards for 2-person integrity

        <b>Lighting</b> - light up dark areas

        <b>Sensors</b> - infrared detectors, Pressure detector, microwave broadcast, etc...

    <b>Deception and Disruption</b>
        <b>Honeypot</b> - attract bad guy

        <b>Honeynets</b> - network of honeypots - larger deceptive network

        <b>Honeyfiles</b> - fake information - alert is sent showing file was accessed

        <b>Honeytoken</b> - add traceable data that allows you to track the malicious actors
<h3>01.03 Change Management; Technical Change Management</h3>
    <b>Change Management</b> - formal process for managing chagnes; avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
        <b><i>Typical process for change management approval:</i></b>
            <i>- complete request form</i>
            <i>- determine purpose of change</i>
            <i>- identify scope of change</i>
            <i>- schedule date and time of change</i>
            <i>- determine affected systems and impact</i>
            <i>- analyze risk associated with change</i>
            <i>- control board Approves or Denies change request</i>
            <i>- get end-user acceptance after the change is complete</i>

        <b>Ownership</b> - individual (or entity) that owns the process
            ex: the Address Label Printer needs to be upgraded, the 'Shipping' department owns the process, but the 'IT' department handles the actual change

        <b>Stakeholder</b> - will want input on the change management process

        <b>Impact Analysis</b> - determine risk value: High, Medium, Low
            <b><i>Risks can be minor or far-reaching</i></b> - ex: data corruption, operating system failures, the patch breaks something else in the system...
            <i>What is the risk with NOT making a change?</i> - vulnerability, application unavailability, downtime with other services

        <b>Sandbox testing environment</b> - safe space to see what changes will do; enables you to figure out 'backout plan'

        <b>Backout plan</b> - if change goes poorly then you need to be able to revert

        <b>Maintenance Window</b> - time frame when changes are made, off hours / change hours; can be challenging in 24 hour 7 day environments

        <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b> - SOP should include change management procedures.

    <b>Technical Change Management</b> - putting change management into action
        'change mangement' is often concerned with "what" needs to change, the technical team is concerned with "how" to change it.

    <b>Allow / Deny List</b> - Security policy can control app execution
        <i>Allow List</i> - nothing runs unless approved on the allow list
        <i>Deny List</i> - anything will run unless on the deny list

    <b>Restricted Activities</b> - scope of change is important
    <b>Downtime</b> - services will temporarily be unavailable; normally scheduled during non-production hours
        <i>Secondary system</i> - avoid downtime by having a secondary system to switch to while implementing change

    <b>Restarts</b> - necessary to implement new configurations
    <b>Legacy Applications</b> - old ass systems or programs
    <b>Dependencies</b> - 1st service only runs if service 2nd service is also running 
    <b>Documentation</b> - often part of change management process - must update everything that has changed in documentation.
    <b>Version Control</b> - keeps detailed configuration, not always straightforward
<h3>01.04 Public Key Infrastructure; Encrypting Data; Key Exchange; Encryption Technologies; Obfuscation; Hashing and Digital Signatures; Blockchain Technology; Certificates</h3>
    <b>Public Key Infrastructure</b> - policy & procedure relating to creating, distributing, managing, storing, and revoking Digital Certificates
        <b><i>also refers to binding of public keys to people or devices in an organization. - Certificate Authority (CA)</i></b>
    
        <b>Symmetric encryption / Secret Key Algorithm</b> - single key, single key is the 'shared secret' to encrypt and decrypt
            <i>Encrypts and decrypts with the same secret key</i> - if key is revealed you will need a new key quickly
            ** Does not scale well, but is very fast
        
        <b>Asymmetric encryption</b> - encrypt with 1 key and decrypt with another
            <i>a Private and Public key</i> - 
                <b><i>Private Key</i></b> - each user will have a private key that is kept secret     
                <b><i>Public Key</i></b> - the public key can be given to anyone, but only matching private keys can decrypt the data
                  
        <b>Key Pair</b> - in Asymmetric encryption (aka Public Key Cryptography)
            <i>Key Generation</i> - builds both Public and Private key at the same time
                                  - Large Prime numbers and lots of randomization; tons of math
            <b><i>Bob wants to send Alice an Asymmetrically encrypted message: bob creates plaintext msg and encrypts with Alice's Public key, this creates the 'Ciphertext'.
                    - Alice receives the encrypted ciphertext and uses her 'Private Key' to unencrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext.          </i></b>
        
        <b>Key Escrow</b> - a private 3rd-party holds the decryption key, this may be within your own organization.
            ** often used in large organizations so that the business / organization can decrypt data if an employee leaves    

    <b>Encrypting Data</b> - 
        <b>Encrypting Stored Data</b> - bitlocker on Windows, will encrypt entire volume or drive
        <b>Encrypt single file</b> - EFS (Encrypting File System) on windows

        <b>Database Encryption</b> - protect stored data and data in transit
        <b>Transparent Encryption</b> - Encrypt all database information with symmetric key
        <b>Record-level Encryption</b> - can encrypt individual columns, use separate symmetric keys for each column    

        <b>Transport Encryption</b> - protect data while traversing the network; HTTPS in browser
        <b>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</b> - encrypt data transmitted over the network regardless of application
            - Client-based VPN using SSL/TLS
            - Site-to-site VPN using IPsec

        <b>Encryption Algorithm</b> - many ways to encrypt data; different algorithms provide different security or speed, etc...
            Both sides must agree on encryption algorithm beforehand; that detail is often hidden from end user
            <b>DES (Data Encryption Standard)</b>
            <b>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</b>
        <b>Key Length</b> - 128-bit or larger for Symmetric keys; 3072-bits and larger for Asymmetric
        <b>Key Stretching / Key Strengthening</b> - salting, you hash the hash of a password to stretch it out longer
        
    <b>Key Exchange</b> - is a logistical challenge; 1 way to solve is through 'out-of-band' exchange of key information (off the internet)
        a way to get around 'out-of-band' exchange is through 'in-band', in-band = encrypting symmetric key asymmetrically and then sharing the symmetric key that way
        'In-band' key exchanges can allow for real-time ecryption / decryption by using 'Session keys'; they are only used for a short session
        <b>Session Key</b> - client encryts a random symmetric key with a server's public key
                           - the server decrypts the shared key and uses it to encrypt data and that creates the 'Session Key'

        Can also create a Symmetric key from Asymmetric keys with 'Public Key Cryptography'
            - if Bob needs to send to Alice then Bob uses his Private Key and Alice's Public key to create a Symmetric Key; 
                Alice then uses her Private key and Bob's Public key to create a matching Symmetric key.    

    <b>Encryption Technologies</b>
        <b>TPM (Trusted Platform Module)</b> - specification for cryptographic functions (Cryptography hardware on a device)
            <b>Persistent memory</b> - TPM has persistent memory (it can store the information)
            <b>Verstile memory</b> - can store keys, securely store BitLocker Keys 
            ** TPM is password protected helping defend against Dictionary attacks (says NO Dictionary Attacks)     

        <b>HSM (Hardware Security Module)</b> - commercial environment version of TPM, used in large business and industry
            <b>Cluster HSMs with redundant power to assure access; can Securely store thousands of cryptographic keys</b>

        <b>Key Management System</b> - allows you to manage the multitude of keys that are required in a modern business environment
            ex: create keys for specific service or cloud provider (SSL/TLS, SSH, etc.); associate keys with specific users; manager can rotate keys on regular intervals; provide logs of key use and important events
        
        <b>Keeping Data Private</b> - hard to keep data secure spread across many devices; constant race against hackers
        <b>Secure Enclave</b> - protected processor, separate from CPU, often implemented as hardware processor
                - Secure enclave is part of many phones, becoming more common for laptops and other devices & has it's own boot ROM
                   secure enclave performs AES encryption inside the hardware and has a true RNG (Random Number Generator)

    <b>Obfuscation</b> - make something more difficult to understand, hiding information in plain site
            - you only know how to see the data if you know the data was hidden and how it was hidden, so that you can unobscure the data. 
        <b>Steganography</b> - hide information inside of images or music; greek for 'Concealed Writing'
            steganography is security through obscurity    
        <b>Covertext</b> - image or music file that hides the obfuscated document or file
            <i>Common Steganography techniques: </i>
                - Network based = Embed message in TCP packet
                - Image = embed msg in image file
                - Music file = embed msg in music file
                - Video file = can store a great deal of data hidden in a video
        <b>Tokenization</b> - type of obfuscation, sensitive information is replaced with placeholder data and then converted after it has been transmitted
            - tokenization is NOT encryption or hashing, the original data and token aren't mathematically related

        <b>Data Masking</b> - hiding some original data, like only seeing last 4 of credit card on receipt; or last 4 of ss# on some forms, etc...

    <b>Hasing and Digital Signatures</b> - message digest or fingerprint; short string of text
        <i>used for Integrity, Non-repudiation, and Authentication</i>

        <b>Collision</b> - if 2 different inputs create the same end hash, that is a collision and it should NEVER happen

        <b>Salting</b> - adding a little more to the hash, used often to help obfuscate passwords
        <b>Rainbow Table</b> - contains words, passwords along with hashed value to quickly check / compare for values against the rainbow table

        Hashes are used in 'Digital Signatures' for <b><i>Integrity</i></b>, proving the message is unchanged
                                                    <b><i>Authentication</i></b>, proves the source of the message
                                                    <b><i>Non-Repudiation</i></b>, verifies the signature

    <b>Blockchain Technology</b> - distributed ledger

    <b>Certificates</b> - 
        <b>Public Key Certificates</b> - contains both public key & digital signature

        Digital Signature is a way of adding 'Trust'. PKI uses CA (Certificate Authority)

        <b>Certificate Authority</b> - 3rd party website hosts certificates and verifies other website is who they say they are

        <b>Certificate Signing Request</b> - take Applicant's 'Public key' and add applicant ID information to create the Certificate Signing Request
                                           - CSR is sent to Certificate Authority and CA validates the applicant CSR using the CA 'Private key' to sign a digital certifiate and issue to the Applicant

        <b>Private Certificates</b> - within organizations private certificates are issued and validated
        <b>Self-signed Certificates</b> - 
        <b>Wildcard Certificates</b> - lists alternate domains that fall under the certificate validation
        <b>CRL (Certificate Revocation List)</b> - list of revoked certificates 
        <b>Heartbleed attack</b> - OpenSSL vulnerability
        
        <b>OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)</b> - scalable
