<h1>CompTIA Security+ 701 Test Study</h1>
<pre>
<h2>01 General Security Concepts</h2>
<h3>01.01 Security Controls</h3> - prevent security event, minimize impact, & limit damage
    <b><i>Technical</i></b> - ex: firewall / anti-virus; os security
    <b><i>Managerial</i></b> - admin controls - security policy
    <b><i>Operational</i></b> - people, security guard
    <b><i>Physical</i></b> - fences, gates, and locks, guard shack

    <b>Preventive Control Type</b> 
        - technical = firewall; managerial = on boarding; operational=guards; physical = locked door
    <b>Deterrent Control Type</b> 
        - technical = splash screen; managerial = demotion / firing; operational = receptionist; physical = posted Warning signs
    <b>Detective Control Type</b> 
        - technical = system logs; managerial = reviewing logs; operational = someone patroling the grounds; physical = motion detectors
    <b>Corrective Control Type</b> 
        - technical = backup; managerial = policy for reporting issues; operational = contact authorities; physical = fire extinguisher
    <b>Compensating Control Type</b> - temp solution
        - technical = block instead of patch; managerial = separation of duties; operational = require multiple security; physical = backup generator
    <b>Directive Control Type</b> - relatively weak, means to 'direct' subject towards security compliance
        - technical = store 'sensitive' files in protected folder; managerial = create compliance policy; operational = security policy training; physical = "Authorized Personnel" sign 
<h3>01.02 CIA Triad; Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting; Gap Analysis; Zero Trust; Physical Security; Deception and Disruption</h3>
    <b>CIA Triad</b>
        <b>Confidentiality</b> - prevent unauthorized data disclosure
            <i>provide confidentiality through: </i>
                <b>encryption</b>
                <b>access controls</b> - restrict access to resource
                <b>authentication</b>
        <b>Integrity</b> - data remains the same; stored and transferred as intended
            <i>provide integrity through: </i>
                <b>hashing</b>
                <b>digital signatures</b>
                <b>certificates</b>
                <b>non-repudiation</b>
        <b>Availability</b> - systems are available
            <i>provide availability through: </i>
                <b>redundancy</b>
                <b>fault tollerance</b>
                <b>patching</b>

    <b>Non-repudiation</b> - being able to verify; 'no taking it back'
        <b>signing a contract</b> - signature adds non-repudiation; others can see the signature
        <b>adds different perspective to cryptography</b> - proof of integrity; proof of origin with high assurance
        <b>Proof of Integrity</b> - verify data remains accurate and the same
            <i>Hashing (or 'Message Digest')</i> - if the data changes the hash changes
        <b>Proof of Origin</b> - Authentication to prove source of message
            <i>signed with 'Private Key'</i> - Private Key is digital signature
            <i>verify with 'Public Key'</i> - Public Key is used to verify origin; changes to message will invalidate signature
        <b>add digital signature - Alice sends plaintext message and hashing algorithm makes hash of plaintext, 
                                 - hash is encrypted with sender (Alice's) private key creating the 'Digital Signature'
                                 - digital signature is sent with plaintext 
                                 - Bob receives message and decrypts digital signature with "Alice's Public Key"
                                 - program verifies hash of plaintext that decrypted from Alice's digital signature</b>

    <b>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting</b> - AAA Framework
        <b>Authentication</b> - Identification (verify we are who we say we are)
        <b>Authorization</b> - What access we have in the system
        <b>Accounting</b> - Logs of what happened; (ex: Login time, data sent and received, logout time)     

        <b>Authenticating People</b> - digitally signed certificates
            <b>Certificate Authority (CA)</b> - authenticates certificates, most large organizations maintain their own certificates
                - the organization will make a 'Certificate' for a device (laptop, tablet, client computer, etc...) and digitally sign the device with the organization's CA
                - the certificate is now used as the authentication for the device; the CA's digital signature is used to validate the certificate
        <b>Authorization Models</b> - associates Users (and Services) -> Data and Applications
              ** challenge is creating relationships that easily scale (not having to associate individual users to their access rights)
            Authorization model is often in the middle of the Users and Services allowing organization to define Roles     
            
        <b>Abstraction</b> - create 'Groups' inside the organization to easily assign 'Authorization' to users (ex: create 'shipping' group and put all shipping department employees into that group of authorizations)

    <b>Gap Analysis</b> - where you are compared to where you want to be, the 'gap' between the two
        <b>Work towards a known Baseline</b> - might be internal goals or organizational standards   
        <b>NIST Framework</b> 
        <b>ISO/IEC Framework</b>
    
        <b>Evaluate People and Processes</b>
        <b><i>Get a baseline of employees</i></b>
        <i>- Employee formal experience</i>
        <i>- Current training</i>
        <i>- Knowledge of security policies and procedures</i>
        
        <b><i>Examine the current processes</i></b>
        <i>- Research existing IT systems</i>
        <i>- Evaluate existing security policies</i>
    
        <b>Compare and Contrast</b>
        <b>the Comparison</b> - evaluate existing systems
        <b>Identify weakness</b> - along with the most effective processes

        <b>Analysis and Report</b>
        <b>the Final Comparison:</b>
            <i>- detailed baseline objectives</i>
            <i>- clear view of the current state</i>

    <b>Zero Trust</b> - holistic approach to network security, covers every device, every process, every person
        <b>Everything Must be Verified</b> - split network into 'Functional Planes' for physical, virtual, and cloud components

        <b>Functional Planes: </b>
            <i><b>Data Plane</b></i> (ports, phsyical ports)- processing frames, packets and networking data
            <i><b>Control Plane</b></i> (configuration settings, rules for the switch, etc...)- manages the actions of the data plane, define policies and rules (Routing Tables, Session Tables, NAT Tables)

        <b>Adaptive Identity</b> - make certain to consider the source of the requested resources, 
                                 - consider 'Risk Indicators' - relationship to organization, physical location, connection type, IP address, etc.
                                 - make authentication stronger, if necessary
        <b>Threat Scope Reduction</b> - decrease number of possible entry points
        <b>Policy-driven Access Control</b> - combine adaptive identity with predefined set of rules

        <b>Security Zones</b> - where person is connecting from; security is more than a 1-to-1 relationship
            <i>create Trusted and Untrusted zones depending on where the traffic originates</i>
            <i>Implicit Trust</i> - if from internal zone, then perhaps the user is trusted
        
        <b>Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)</b> - placed between the system and 'Trusted' Enterprise resources
        <b>Policy Decision Point (PDP)</b> - process for making the authentication decision 
            <b>Policy Engine</b> - evaluates access decision based on policy and info source; Grant, Deny, or Revoke
            <b>Policy Administrator</b> - communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), generates access tokens, tells PEP to allow or disallow access

        <b>Overview of Zero-point</b>:
          <b><i>- 'Subject' and 'System' from 'Untrusted' network communicate with PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) across the Data Plane.
                - The information is communicated to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) while in the Control Plane and the decision is communicated from the PDP / Control Plane, back to the PEP in the Data Plane
                - Access is Granted, Denied, or Revoked; if granted then access is allowed to the 'enterprise resource'</i></b>

    <b>Physical Security</b>
        <b>Bollard / Barricade</b> - prevent access, channel access to specific point, identify safety concern; could include concrete bollards or moats

        <b>Access control vesitbule</b> - control access to particular area

        <b>Fencing</b> - builds a perimeter

        <b>Video Surveillance</b> - CCTV (Closed Circuit TV)

        <b>Guards / Access badges</b> - physical protection; many times have multiple guards for 2-person integrity

        <b>Lighting</b> - light up dark areas

        <b>Sensors</b> - infrared detectors, Pressure detector, microwave broadcast, etc...

    <b>Deception and Disruption</b>
        <b>Honeypot</b> - attract bad guy

        <b>Honeynets</b> - network of honeypots - larger deceptive network

        <b>Honeyfiles</b> - fake information - alert is sent showing file was accessed

        <b>Honeytoken</b> - add traceable data that allows you to track the malicious actors
<h3>01.03 Change Management; Technical Change Management</h3>
    <b>Change Management</b> - formal process for managing chagnes; avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
        <b><i>Typical process for change management approval:</i></b>
            <i>- complete request form</i>
            <i>- determine purpose of change</i>
            <i>- identify scope of change</i>
            <i>- schedule date and time of change</i>
            <i>- determine affected systems and impact</i>
            <i>- analyze risk associated with change</i>
            <i>- control board Approves or Denies change request</i>
            <i>- get end-user acceptance after the change is complete</i>

        <b>Ownership</b> - individual (or entity) that owns the process
            ex: the Address Label Printer needs to be upgraded, the 'Shipping' department owns the process, but the 'IT' department handles the actual change

        <b>Stakeholder</b> - will want input on the change management process

        <b>Impact Analysis</b> - determine risk value: High, Medium, Low
            <b><i>Risks can be minor or far-reaching</i></b> - ex: data corruption, operating system failures, the patch breaks something else in the system...
            <i>What is the risk with NOT making a change?</i> - vulnerability, application unavailability, downtime with other services

        <b>Sandbox testing environment</b> - safe space to see what changes will do; enables you to figure out 'backout plan'

        <b>Backout plan</b> - if change goes poorly then you need to be able to revert

        <b>Maintenance Window</b> - time frame when changes are made, off hours / change hours; can be challenging in 24 hour 7 day environments

        <b>Standard Operating Procedure</b> - SOP should include change management procedures.

    <b>Technical Change Management</b> - putting change management into action
        'change mangement' is often concerned with "what" needs to change, the technical team is concerned with "how" to change it.

    <b>Allow / Deny List</b> - Security policy can control app execution
        <i>Allow List</i> - nothing runs unless approved on the allow list
        <i>Deny List</i> - anything will run unless on the deny list

    <b>Restricted Activities</b> - scope of change is important
    <b>Downtime</b> - services will temporarily be unavailable; normally scheduled during non-production hours
        <i>Secondary system</i> - avoid downtime by having a secondary system to switch to while implementing change

    <b>Restarts</b> - necessary to implement new configurations
    <b>Legacy Applications</b> - old ass systems or programs
    <b>Dependencies</b> - 1st service only runs if service 2nd service is also running 
    <b>Documentation</b> - often part of change management process - must update everything that has changed in documentation.
    <b>Version Control</b> - keeps detailed configuration, not always straightforward
